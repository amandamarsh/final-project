I spent far too much time thinking of a viable project idea. I examined the casualty search for a great number of time. I pulled many files, edited spreadsheets and searched for oter sources of information. In my attempts to conduct additional research regarding some of the casualties I found, I was hoping to be struck wiht an idea that would make the project succesfull. However, after a search gave me no good information I had to abandon that idea.
I abandoned work that I had spent a while flipping through and desperately trying to uncover soemthing. This time could've been put to better use. However, I now know more about the casualties that were filed with my same last name. I researched the casualties that were from the part of Nova Scotia I know my family comes from. Interesting bit of personal information if nothing else. 
My graphs were easy and seamless to make- at first. I completed the second set a few days after my initial work and struggled to remember how I got the format the way I liked. After trouble shootign for a while, the answer was in the "stack data" button.
When pulling information from the Shawville Equity, I was overwhelmed with information. There are so many editions available. I originally wanted to take every edition published in 1900, 1950 and 2000 and examine them. However, the amount of files that would be and time it would take seemed unrealistic. I settled for looking at the first January edition for the beginning of each decade 1900-2000.
Some of the editions were rough
