Advertisements
The ads for services have increased throughout time.
Ads for medicines have dramatically decreased. 
The types of entertainment ads we usually see today started emerging in the mid 20th century. 
The ads for raw materials dramatically decreased, as expected.
Strangely the number of advertisements seemed to decreaseover time, I epected the opposite to be true.
However, advertisements seemed to get bigger in size and became more attention-grabbing throughout the decades.

Classifieds
employment has stayed a consistently popular category in the classifieds.
The rest is pretty sporadic. 
Peak of raw material ads don't seem to correlate to peaks in related categories in the classifieds.
The language very much changes through out time. 
The requests for 'servants' diminishes.
As does the requests for employees of a certain gender only.
The earlier job classifieds often specified no experience was needed.
